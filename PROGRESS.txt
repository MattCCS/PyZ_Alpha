(This file is for per-feature progress reporting, for review afterward)

( 9-8-15 / Object integration )
+ have objects render-cycling, on a (near-)global timer
    + if timeout, no game update/aging occurs (hopefully)
+ converted trees to objects
    - but don't perform checks for them yet
- NEED to combine "blocking" with objects present in node!
+ made "passability" check for objects
+ made lantern an object (on the ground)
+ MADE OCCLUSION DYNAMIC <3

( 9-9-15 / ... )
BIG CHANGES
+ added debug '(l)ook' command
+ separated NODES and OBJECTS in terms of data categorization
    (nodes will eventually just be containers for objects)
+ changed 'passable' to 'impassible', as most objects should default to passable
+ changed 'transparent' to 'occluder', added global potential-occlusion dataset, allows dynamic occlusion
+ made trees objects, as they should be
+ combat now checks for a SINGLE attackable object on the node, send the attack to it instead
    + nodes can't be attacked
+ removed 'self.blocked' set, as it no longer made sense to have
+ delegated the GameObject class to age/kill its objects
+ gave GameObjects the same sexy '__getitem__' as DataObjects for attribute lookups
+ added sounds
- NEED to change how attack sounds are determined
- NEED to change how colors are determined (by material)
    - NEED to make materials their own JSON type, with colors and densities, etc.
- NEED to make the canvas-cycle timer global
- NEED to make 'news' globally-accessible
! multiple coordinate-edge-radius values allow for "thick"/"thin" objects!  do this!
